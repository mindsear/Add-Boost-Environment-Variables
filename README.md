# Add-Boost-Environment-Variables <br />
## This is another version of the application, used for every system variable <br />
This is a mini tool to ease the replacement of Boost Environment Variables in Windows (7,8,8.1,10)  <br />
Tested only on windows 10, but I do believe it's working on windows >= 7 <br />
<br />
<br />
**Update:** Tested on Windows 7 and it's working.<br />
**Update2:** The app is working without Running it as Administrator.<br />
