# Add-Boost-Environment-Variables <br />
## This version (master branch) is recommended for newbies or people who wanna change only the boost variable <br />
Download the latest version 2.0: https://github.com/mindsear/Add-Boost-Environment-Variables/releases/tag/v2.0 <br />
This is a mini tool to ease the replacement of Boost Environment Variables in Windows (7,8,8.1,10)  <br />
Tested only on windows 10, but I do believe it's working on windows >= 7 <br />
<br />

**Update:** Tested on Windows 7 and it's working. <br />
**Update2:** The app is working without Running it as Administrator. <br />
